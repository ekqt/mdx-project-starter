# MDX Project Starter

This is a statically generated blog example using Next.js, MDX and TailwindCSS. Here are some important design considerations:

-   The blog page styling depends on TailwindCSS's plugin `@tailwindcss/typography`

-   TypeScript-friendly, although it can be removed and replaced by JavaScript

## How to use

We just used a `###` subheading in our blog post.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ekqt/{...}
$ cd {folder-directory}
$ npm install
```
